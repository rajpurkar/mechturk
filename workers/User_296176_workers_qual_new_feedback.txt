	withdraw qualification

	points are still off hence -> puffff...

	ok, but point placement is a bit off, e.g. points are marking tip of the knee instead of knee joint (see hint message)

worker: AWQA4ZFWKMCA9, num_hits: 18, num_accept: 18
	good, one image is a bit incorrect but it was a difficult image

	qualification will be withdrawn

	withdraw qualification next time? 

	AGAIN, shoulder tips, hips on the side: e.g 22XQ0ONNVRH3GNH0BHIBF6NVT25VMS

	ok, BUT really problematic placement of shoulder and elbow and hip points - annotates tips not joints
	this is particularly visible on this hit 2MX3Q0JG5TYOJIPP850FHSSS1BDFJ5

	again, hips are consistently not annotated in some images, e.g. 28YNTBJ3MMDZ1LIYK7TKPB9MXKPXB0			

	pretty good, also many hits done, minor thing: 
		2HJ1K274J79MM2ZS5OV62XFCXIGEGH - did not annotate hips, but they are inside the image, also a few other images

	ok, check again when more images are available

worker: AHN6EHPD7LRNF, num_hits: 6, num_accept: 6

A2PYZOYSTXFCBZ

	good, in a few images hips are at the side of the body, not at the "hip joint", e.g. 26ZIT3HVWAVMECVEGRT1F2Z9TSVMEC
	looks better in 1304_b2, check again

A33UH6JW6H9ROD
A3B0AB2C9SIHN
	granted qualification again (after email?), reasonable work, check again

	yes, qualification will be withdrawn 

	withdraw qualification?

	some images are still problematic: e.g. hips are off in this HIT: 

	has problems with shoulder and hip joints, e.g. 2ELV0FK0COK4FKUD4QBKHLRWQQDIPD
	seems to got better in 1304_b2, check again
	good work, definitely got better

	ok, minor things: did not annotate left ankle in 2NORLPHIT3HXSGOBF7TNRQ21RJLIAZ, did not annotate eyes and nose in 2YGW2GTP9RA9OBPDY70Y0OF7K08PUU

	good work :)
	
	looks ok, but found a couple mistakes (e.g. legs too short, missing point on elbow)

	looks ok, problematic occluded points labeling (sometimes visible marked as occluded) 2N9LPHIT3HVY61D933EJY217MMABJQ, 2KLFDEY5COW2HMKQ093RNLC6FAV3UN

	overall good, in the sideview hip joints are not centered with respect to the limb, marked as if they would be at the front surface of the person, e.g. 2YXL42J1LY5A7DVYJ19GNKHDL8CP45
	looks ok, but the knee point is at the tip, not centered on the joint: HITID 2RIRYNJ92NJMI6Y2JKKUPYW2071B6D

	found crappy annotation

A79CHO3NW2IPO
	good work
	ok, but too few images to really tell

	next time: withdraw qualification if results not good 

	bad mistake, hands not labeled: 2JGU98JHSTLDZRT68K0IWBJE3EFEQK, shoulders not labeled: 20I11K274J7BGWPXY9E4EUXFW05DFW, wrist not at the correct location: 2KLFDEY5COW2HMKQ093RNLC6FAW3UO, 
	    misplaced points: 2CO6RLPHIT3JR23MHJX2VJQ2LU49HA

	good work (check again)

	check again, looks good, in a few images hips are a bit off (e.g. too low)
	hips are still a bit off, e.g. too low in 2C18EBDPGFL8RIINWAINLWIOF38H2Y and 2B8IHPCGJ2D4XUWN2Y80RPPS24093B
